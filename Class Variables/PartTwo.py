# Python Object-Oriented Programming: Class Variables


class Employee(object):
    # self is the first argument a class always takes
    # self refers to the instance of said object
    # self is used for accessing fields or methods(functions)
    # within a class

    # every instance of said class they can be accessed via the
    # Class itself or the instance Employee.raise_amount/self.raise_amount

        # The initialiser method/ contructor, __init__ for short
        # is the blueprint for what variables/fields every instance
        # of said object must be passed to it before it can be created
        # this is alot more efficient than doing it manually

## Accessing class variables ##
# Employee.raise_amount = 1.05
# When accessing a class variable using an instance
# python checks if the instance contains that attribute as such
# using the __dict__ attribute which returns a dictionary or other mapping object
# used to store an objectâ€™s (writable) attributes.
# print(emp_1.__dict__)

# if not then python checks the inheriting class for said attribute
# print(Employee.__dict__)
# print(emp_1.raise_amount)
# print(emp_2.raise_amount)
###############################

## NameSpace ##

# Creates a variable within the namespace of the instance
# This is entirely different than using the object itself to
# perform the global assigment, as explained in the previous block
# This is the same as creating an new field within the emp_1 instance
# As oppose to this: Employee.raise_amount = 1.05 which sets the value
# for all instances of Employee again explained in the previous block
# emp_1.raise_amount = 1.05
# print(Employee.raise_amount)
# print(emp_1.raise_amount)
# print(emp_2.raise_amount)
# print(emp_1.__dict__)

# Increments the class variable num_employees by 1 each time
# a new instance is created
# print(Employee.num_of_employees)

# Accessing the num_of_employees class variable
# print(emp_1.num_of_employees)
